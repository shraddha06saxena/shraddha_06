# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification App

> 🔧 Developed as part of **CodSoft Virtual Internship – Data Science**

This is an interactive machine learning web app that classifies Iris flowers into three species: **Iris Setosa**, **Iris Versicolor**, and **Iris Virginica** based on petal and sepal measurements. It features real-time predictions, feature importance analysis, and visually engaging cards.


## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Random Forest Classifier** for accurate species prediction  
- 🎛️ **Interactive sliders** to input flower measurements  
- 🌺 **Predicted species display** with matching image  
- 📊 **Feature Importance Table & Chart**  
- 🖼️ **Clickable real-world Iris examples** linked to Wikipedia  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** with hover effects and tooltip insights

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for web UI  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**
